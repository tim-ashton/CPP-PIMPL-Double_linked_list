# CPP-PIMPL-Double_linked_list

I wanted to implement a class using PIMPL (Pointer to Implementation (I quite prefer the term "Cheshire Cat")) so I decided to implement this simple linked list using the PIMPL pattern.

"The pimpl idiom is a modern C++ technique to hide implementation, to minimize coupling, and to separate interfaces."
