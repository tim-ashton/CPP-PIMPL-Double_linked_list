# CPP-PIMPL-Double_linked_list

I wanted to implement a class using PIMPL (Pointer to Implementation) "Cheshire Cat" idiom, so I decided to do this simple linked list class using the pattern.

A range of test cases have been implemented against the functions in the doubly linked list class and I used Valgrind to profile the project. No memory leaks or invalid reads were detected on the final commit.

"The pimpl idiom is a modern C++ technique to hide implementation, to minimize coupling, and to separate interfaces."
